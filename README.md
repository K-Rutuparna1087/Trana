# 🚨 The Problem

Modern emergency systems are:

- ⏳ Slow and centralized  
- 🔗 Fragmented across agencies  
- 📉 Reactive instead of predictive  
- 📶 Dependent on strong network conditions  
- 🌍 Not accessible to diverse language communities  
- ❓ Lacking accountability and measurable safety metrics  

In critical moments, delays cost lives.
